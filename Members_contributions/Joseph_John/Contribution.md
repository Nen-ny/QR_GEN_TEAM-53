My contribution to the achievement of the project:

- I was asked to [Research on QR code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15mNHdywHrdOWeGcT3cAtkXVIuz--_KQGmZxtXSV30MY/edit?usp=drivesdk) detailing what's in trend with QR codes right now, what they are failing at and how we can improve on it
- [Create mock site for test Django server](https://github.com/zuri-training/QR_GEN_TEAM-53/issues/11#)
- [Create Settings frontend page](https://github.com/zuri-training/QR_GEN_TEAM-53/issues/14#)
- [Create Contact frontend page](https://github.com/zuri-training/QR_GEN_TEAM-53/issues/14#)
- Create 404 error frontend page
