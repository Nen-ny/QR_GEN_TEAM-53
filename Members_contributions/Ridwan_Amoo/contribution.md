# First Task Assigned

In the beginning of the project phase, i was tasked with doing the research to read and understand the python package to be used, in order to implement QR code generation on our website.

# Solution 

In my research, i found out about a python package called Segno, what makes segno unique is that it allows different output format from one single qr code, which makes it easy to create a qr code that can be downloaded by user in different format. 

Here is a link to the package documentation [this](https://segno.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Evidence of work
After, going through the documentation. i tried and create basic qr code on my github repo, here is the [link](https://github.com/Ralatcode/Django-Qr-code-Generator/tree/main/files)


# Second task Assigned

# Solution 

I created mobile and desktop responsive sign up and login pages and made changes to match the design files of the designers, the pages were created with HTML and CSS, and i used Flexbox and Grid Layout System.
